# Azure App Service

## How do I SSH to my custom container running in App Service?

I have created example application that has all this done so you
can easily test this yourself: [JanneMattila/327-webapp-remote-access](https://github.com/JanneMattila/327-webapp-remote-access). README should contain steps to get it setup correctly.
